### Minimal Dockerfile for PHP projects

Imagine a small script like [https://github.com/cavo789/json_encode](https://github.com/cavo789/json_encode).

There is no dependencies to any services like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Such application can be easily put in a Docker container using this `Dockerfile`:

```text
# Run this application by running the next command in a console:
# docker build --pull --rm -t appName:latest . && docker run -p 80:80 -d -v %cd%:/var/www/html --name appName appName
# (under Windows, `%cd%` means *the current directory*)
FROM php:8.0-apache
WORKDIR /var/www/html
#COPY . .
EXPOSE 80
```

1. Create a new file called `Dockerfile` in your application root and copy the lines here above in the file.
2. Build your application Docker image by running `docker build --pull --rm -t appName:latest .` where `appName` can be anything you want.
3. Run `docker run -p 80:80 -d -v %cd%:/var/www/html --name appName appName`
4. Start your browser and surf to `http://127.0.0.1` to start your application.

#### Copy or using a volume?

By running `docker run -p 80:80 -d -v %cd%:/var/www/html --name appName appName` i.e. using the `-v` parameter, you'll set a volume i.e. you'll synchronize a folder on your host (`%cd` means the current directory in DOS) to a folder in your container (here, the folder `/var/www/html`).

This means that if you change a file, the change is reflected in the container or vice-versa (if you delete a file in the container, it's deleted on your host too).

If you don't want a synchronization, don't use the `-v` parameter and uncomment the `COPY . .` line in the `Dockerfile`.

The `COPY . .` statement order to make a copy of all files present in your host current directory (and sub-directories) inside the container. There will be no synchronization: you can't change a file on your host and hope the change is done in the container too. And files created, modified or even deleted in the container stays in the container; just like a *sandbox*.

## Tips

<!-- below, content of ./tips/dockerfile_or_script/readme.md -->

### Using Dockerfile or put it in a script?

Sometimes, you can put actions directly in the Dockerfile (using the `RUN` command) or in a Bash script that you're still using as an entrypoint (f.i. `ENTRYPOINT [ "/bin/bash", "-c", "/home/node/.docker/app/entrypoint.sh" ]`).

There is a big difference! The file `Dockerfile` is only used when building the image (i.e. `docker-compose build`). The file `docker-compose.yml` is used every time you start `docker-compose up`.

Put in the `Dockerfile` any statements needed to build your image and make that image usable. Using the `RUN` command, the action will be put in a layer by Docker and if nothing change, the layer will be reused during the next built action. This will greatly increase the performance by reducing the time needed for the built.

Let's consider the `composer install` (or `yarn install`) action: did you need to run it every time the image is used or, only, when the image is built?

If you put it in the `Dockerfile` as a `RUN` command, while the `composer.json` file (or `package.json`) isn't modified, the layer is still valid so no need to run the command once more. That's the best choice.

<!-- below, content of ./tips/npm_node_modules/readme.md -->

### NPM - Folder node_modules

NPM didn't force to put that folder in the project directory, you can put it somewhere else then just add the folder's location to the PATH.

Consider this example:

```Dockerfile
WORKDIR /opt/node_app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN \
    yarn install --production=false --no-optional; \
    yarn cache clean --force; \

### Add this folder in the PATH so npm can retrieve it from there
ENV PATH="/opt/node_app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH"

WORKDIR /home/node

COPY --chown=node:node . .

### RUN ln -s /opt/node_app/node_modules node_modules

RUN yarn dev
```

We'll use the `/opt/node_app` folder and copy there the `package.json` (and `package-lock.json` if any) then run `yarn install` from there. Installing dependencies is put in a separate layer so while the `package.json` file isn't modified, the layer stay valid and shouldn't be executed again. **We'll have a better experience with less time needed for the built of the image.**

We'll update the `PATH` variable and add our `/opt/node_app` folder.

Then we'll switch to the `/home/node` folder where our application is installed, copy our project's files between the host and the container.

Finally, we start yarn. Since the `node_modules` is not there, yarn / npm will search for the modules in the `PATH` and will retrieve our files.

Note: if this doesn't work, just uncomment the `RUN ls` command.

### Storing secrets

> [https://davidwalsh.name/docker-compose-override](https://davidwalsh.name/docker-compose-override)

Just use a `docker-compose.override.yml` file and add that file in your `.gitignore` file.

```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  myservice:
    environment:
      - APP_KEY=32xlkjwe9sd9x8jx9we8sd9sdad
```

Docker-compose will automatically merge `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml`. Nothing to do for this.
